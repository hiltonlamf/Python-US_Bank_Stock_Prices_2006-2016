# Python-US_Bank_Stock_Prices_2006-2016
In this data project, I attempt to use Python to understand and visualize the change in stock prices of 6 major U.S. banks from 2006 to 2016, with special focus on the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The 6 banks in this analysis are Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.

Unfortunately Github is not able to display the interactive visualizations used in this project, which is originally produced on Jypter Notebook.

For full experience, please clone and view it on Jypter notebook or visit http://hiltonlam.com/PythonAnalysis_US_Bank_Stock_2006-2016.html for a HTML display.
