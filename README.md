# Python-US_Bank_Stock_Prices_2006-2016
In this data project, I attempt to use Python to understand and visualize the change in stock prices of 6 major U.S. banks from 2006 to 2016, with special focus on the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The 6 banks in this analysis are Bank of America, CitiGroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.
